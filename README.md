# Javabasics
Hey Guys!
I am a master's student at Wichita State University,Kansas.
Just started with programming, I am learning java through linkedin learning. Started the course, learning java, a basic fundamental java course just for basics.
With the help of the course, I just learnt a few java basic programs and tested it out uploaded to github.
Thank you,
